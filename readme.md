# Transfer Learning Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of transfer learning for image classification using a pre-trained deep learning model. Transfer learning leverages the knowledge of a model trained on a large dataset and adapts it to a specific task with a smaller dataset, significantly reducing training time and improving performance.

In this project, we utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset to classify images from the [Microsoft Cats vs. Dogs Dataset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765).

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **Microsoft Cats vs. Dogs Dataset**. It contains images of cats and dogs, making it ideal for binary classification tasks.
